        example an include guard or a symbol of a source file which is
        not built, would otherwise have to be deleted after every run.

        The ``filter`` selects them.  It is a list of ``include`` and
        ``exclude`` rules, each holding fnmatch patterns.  The rules of
        the configuration are evaluated first and the rules of the group

        the two levels is visible in their order rather than hidden in
        the name of a setting.

        An item no rule matches stays.  A group which specifies its
        interface therefore ends its filter with an ``exclude`` of
        ``'*'``.  A filter of excludes alone cannot express that: a
        register map holds thousands of names, so the rules would have
        to name each one, and a name added by a later vendor release
        would enter the interface unnoticed.

        declaration.  No filter applies to it, so that the
